# Assembly.js

A dream javascript framework for modern routed single page apps. Distributes as a RequireJS package bringing in its awesomeness, and so far depends on several things from jQuery. You would leverage jQuery anyway, right?

The documentation is a work in progress so for the time being please refer to the example demo app code to see how things work and adore that.


## Demo application

Here is the [demo](http://mcmlxxxiii.github.io/Assembly.js/demo/) running online. However, if you decide to take a deeper look and play with the code on your local machine, the easiest way to run the app, perhaps, would be **(1)** to run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` from the repo root and **(2)** point your browser to `localhost:8000`.


## Topics to be expanded

- Architecture overview.
- How features work and how to create custom ones.
- How to use core features. Conventions they bring in.
